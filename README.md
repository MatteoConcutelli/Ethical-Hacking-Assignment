# Ethical-Hacking-Assignment 🕵️‍♂️🔍

## Overview

This repository contains the reports for the Ethical Hacking assignment made by me and my other three colleagues. 📁

## Assignment Description  📚

The Ethical Hacking assignment consists of two phases:

1. **Construction and Configuration of a Vulnerable VM**: The task of each group was to construct a VM with pre-built vulnerabilities that would grant the penetration tester remote access and privilege elevation to root.
2. **Penetration Testing of a Randomly Assigned VM**: The groups were assigned another group's VM with the task of finding its vulnerabilities, exploiting them, gaining local access, and ultimately having root privileges.

## Contents
- **Reports/**: Two reports:
- `VM_Report.pdf`: This will outline in detail the configuration of the VM as well as the vulnerabilities introduced.
- `Penetration_Testing_Report.pdf`: A report of the penetration testing activities conducted on the assigned target VM.  📜

## VM Design  🏗️
The created VM is based on Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS but intentionally introduces vulnerabilities that permit remote access and subsequent privilege escalation.

## Usage Instructions 📜
To use the VM:
1. The VM can be downloaded from [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M4-EpXrN4JHkClAVfyBYH6qS_WBWMGFe?usp=sharing].
2. Import the VM into VirtualBox.
3. Follow the instructions described in the report and reproduce the vulnerabilities to test the attack.
